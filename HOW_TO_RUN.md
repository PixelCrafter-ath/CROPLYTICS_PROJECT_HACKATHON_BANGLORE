#  How to Run the Application

## Quick Start !!  ** project frontend is crashing due incomplete framework**

### Option 1: Double-click START_HERE.bat
Simply double-click the `START_HERE.bat` file in Windows Explorer. It will:
- Activate the virtual environment automatically
- Start the Flask server
- Show you the URL to access

### Option 2: Use Command Line

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\START_HERE.bat
```

**Or manually:**
```powershell
# Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run the app
python app.py
```

**Windows Command Prompt:**
```cmd
START_HERE.bat
```

## What You'll See

After running, you should see:
```
============================================================
Starting Flask application...
Server running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to stop the server
============================================================

✓ Server is running!
✓ Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser
✓ Press CTRL+C to stop the server
```

**There are warnings on frontend and we are solving it**

## Access the Application

Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to:

- **Home Page:** http://127.0.0.1:5000
- **Disease Detection:** http://127.0.0.1:5000/disease-detection
- **Yield Forecast:** http://127.0.0.1:5000/yield-forecast

## Stop the Server

Press `CTRL+C` in the terminal window to stop the server.

## Troubleshooting

### If terminal doesn't open:
1. Right-click `START_HERE.bat`
2. Select "Run as administrator"
3. Or open Command Prompt/PowerShell manually and navigate to the folder

### If you see "virtual environment not found":
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### If port 5000 is already in use:
Edit `app.py` and change the port:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)  # Change 5000 to 5001
```

## Notes

- The "development server" warning has been suppressed - it's safe to ignore
- The app runs in debug mode for development
- For production, use a proper WSGI server like gunicorn

## All Fixed Issues

✅ Flask development server warning - Suppressed
✅ XGBoost version warnings - Suppressed  
✅ scikit-learn version warnings - Suppressed
✅ Clean terminal output - Implemented
✅ Easy startup script - Created

Enjoy your application!
